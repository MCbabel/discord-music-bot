## Discord Bot Permissions

To ensure that your bot works correctly, you need to invite it to your server with the necessary permissions. Use the following OAuth2 URL to generate an invite link for your bot:

```
https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&permissions=277083450752&scope=bot%20applications.commands
```

Replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` with your bot's client ID, which you can find in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

### Required Permissions

- `View Channels`: Allows the bot to see text channels and read messages.
- `Send Messages`: Allows the bot to send messages in text channels.
- `Connect`: Allows the bot to connect to voice channels.
- `Speak`: Allows the bot to play audio in voice channels.
- `Use Slash Commands`: Allows the bot to register and use slash commands.
- `Manage Messages`: Required for the `/clear` command to delete messages.
- `Embed Links`: Allows the bot to send embedded rich content.
- `Read Message History`: Allows the bot to read message history (useful for commands like `/lyrics`).
