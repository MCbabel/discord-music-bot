## Discord Bot Permissions

To ensure that your bot works correctly, you need to invite it to your server with the necessary permissions. Use the following OAuth2 URL to generate an invite link for your bot:

https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&permissions=3147776&scope=bot%20applications.commands

Replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` with your bot's client ID.

### Required Permissions

- `Send Messages`: Allows the bot to send messages in text channels.
- `Connect`: Allows the bot to connect to voice channels.
- `Speak`: Allows the bot to play audio in voice channels.
